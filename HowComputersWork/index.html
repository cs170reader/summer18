            <b><span class="cap">W</span>hat <i>is</i> a computer?</b>
            It's always nice to have a mental picture,
            so I think of a computer as an <b>information processor</b>,
            like <i>Cuisinart</i> for words and numbers and ideas.
            <img src="images/cuisinart.png" class="right" alt="A Cuisinart food processor">
        </p>
        <p> Instead of vegetables, we feed a computer <b>data</b>; the raw facts
            figures and symbols we have to work with. The computer uses
            <b>programs</b> stored in memory to turn that data into
            <b>information</b>; data that's organized, meaningful and useful.
            (If the data contains errors, then the information
            won't be useful; that's <b>GIGO</b>:
            <i>Garbage IN; Garbage OUT</i>).
        </p>

    <p> The three steps that your computer goes through to turn
        <b>data</b> into <b>information</b> is called the
        <b>information processing cycle</b>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Input</b> : retrieving the data to work on.</li>
        <li><b>Processing</b> : analyzing, organizing and transforming the input.</li>
        <li><b>Output</b> : displaying the results of the calculations or sending them
            on to the next step in the process.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> A computer system uses <b>hardware</b>, (the physical
        parts of your computer), and <b>software</b>
        (the programs used by the hardware), to carry out these steps.
    </p>
    <h3>Input and Output</h3>
        <p>An <b>input device</b> is a piece of hardware that's used to:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>to enter <b>data</b>, such as the text in a letter, or the numbers in your checkbook,</li>
            <li>or <b>commands</b> for the computer to perform.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p> Input devices include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>keyboards</b>, used to enter both instructions and data</li>
            <li><b>mice</b>, <b>trackballs</b> and <b>touchpads</b> which are often used to issue instructions, but which can be a source of data as well</li>
            <li><b>joysticks</b> and other <b>gaming controllers</b></li>
            <li><b>graphics tablets</b>, used for free-hand drawing input by artists</li>
            <li>various kinds of <b>touch screens</b> like those found on your phone or tablet</li>
        </ul>
        <img class='inlineCenter shadow' style='width:65%;'
            src='images/computer-414059_640.jpg'>
        <p> Other input devices include <b>digital cameras</b>, both still and video,
            <b>microphones</b> to record sound,
            and <b>scanners</b>, which can digitize photographs,
            or which can be used to convert printed text
            to a form usable in a word processor (OCR).
        </p>
        <p> If input devices give you a way to talk <b>to</b> your computer, then <b>output devices</b> let
            your computer "talk back". An output device is a piece of hardware that the computer
            uses to display information. The most common output device is the one you're looking at
            right now: your computer's screen, or <b>monitor</b>.
        </p>
        <p> Of course, if you reading these lessons off of the printed page, then you're
            making use of the <i>other</i> major output device,
            the <b>printer</b>, which is used to produce <b>hard-copy</b>.
        </p>
        <p> Not all output is visual; your computer is equally adept at producing audio output
            using <b>speakers</b> or <b>earbuds</b>.
        </p>
    <h3>The System Unit</h3>
        <p>We've got input, we've got output, but <b>where's the computer</b>? Where does
            the processing take place? The computer itself is usually located in <b>the system unit</b>,
            often described as "<i>the box-like case containing the electronic components used to
                run programs and process data</i>".
        </p>
        <img src="images/imac2.jpg" class='right' alt="An Imac">
        <img src="images/imac1.jpg" class='left' alt="An IMac computer">
        <p> The "box-like case" part describes most IBM-compatible PCs. Not <b>all</b> systems look like boxes, though;
            the original Apple iMacs, for instance,
            had their system unit combined with the monitor like the picture on the left, while the second-generation iMacs
            had a "mushroom like", rather than "box-like" case, like the picture on the right. The latest iMacs use a
            all-in-one flat-panel combined monitor/system-unit design.<br>
            <img src='images/imac3.jpg' class='inlineCenter' alt='A new iMac computer.'>
        </p>
        <p> On a laptop computer, you'll usually find the system unit beneath the computer's keyboard.
            On a tablet, it is behind the screen. In any event, the important thing to remember is
            that the system unit contains the "real" computer itself.
        </p>
    <h4>The CPU and Memory</h4>
        <p> While the system unit itself is filled with hundreds of different components, the
            two main parts of the "computer itself" are:
        </p>
        <img src='images/cpu.png' alt='An Intel Quad-Core CPU.' class='right'>
        <ul>
            <li>the <b>Central Processing Unit</b> or CPU</li>
            <li>memory</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, the part that actually does calculations,
            the part that "plays" the programs you load. When
            you run a program, its instructions are carried out by the CPU.
        </p>
        <p> However, the CPU can only execute a handful of instructions
            at any given time; the rest of the instructions, (along with that French paper
            you're writing), are stored in a portion of the System Unit called <b>memory</b>.
        </p>
        <p> Memory, (usually called <b>RAM</b>, or <b>Random Access Memory</b>), is a temporary holding
            place for data and instructions, used only while your program is running. This is
            an important and fundamental concept: the CPU <b>cannot</b> act on instructions or
            data stored on a CD or a hard disk; instead, <b>all</b> data and <b>all</b> instructions must
            be loaded into memory, where it can then be accessed by the CPU.
        </p>

        <p> The word <b>temporary</b> is also a fundamental concept. All data and all instructions
            in memory are retained <b>only</b> while your computer is "powered up". When you turn
            off the power to your computer, all the work you've done on "Balzac versus Bluto"
            is completely erased.
        </p>
    <h3>Secondary Storage</h3>
        <p> Primary storage refers to dynamic memory, which we just discussed.
            Secondary storage consists of two parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>storage media</b> where your data is actually stored</li>
            <li>a <b>storage device</b>, the piece of hardware that records or retrieves your data</li>
        </ul>
        <p> These two parts are <b>tightly</b> linked: if you use a CDR as your
            storage media, then you <b>must</b> use a CD Recorder as your storage
            device&#8212;you can't read or write your CD using the floppy disk drive,
            for instance.
        </p>
    <h4>Mechanical Hard Drives</h4>
        <p> The <b>hard disk</b> is the main form of secondary storage used by today's
            desktop computers and laptops.
        </p>
        <p> <img src='images/harddrive.jpg' alt='A hard-disk drive.' class='right'>
            To picture a hard disk, imagine a stack of pancakes. Now, imagine that
            each pancake is a rigid metal platter, coated on both sides with
            magnetic media, and mounted on a rapidly turning spindle. That's
            the hard drive, which is usually located <i>inside</i> the system unit.
        </p>
        <p> Hard drives have two advantages over all other storage media:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>they have very large capacity; even the least expensive 
                consumer-level PCs shipping today has at least a 500 GB (Gigabyte) drive,
                with 1 and 2 TB (Terabyte) drives very common.
            </li>
            <li>Hard disks are also very, very fast, which means that programs and data
                are loaded and stored quickly, compared to running from a removable
                drive.
            </li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Solid State Disks</h4>
        <p> Most lightweight laptop computers now come with <b>SSD</b> or Solid State
            Disk drives instead of mechanical, magnetic-platter-based hard drives.
            SSD drives have the advantages of less weight and no moving parts;
            while currently more expensive and with somewhat lower
            performance than mechanical drives.
        </p>
    <h2>Memory and Data Representation</h2>
        <p><img src="images/b06.gif" class='right shadow' style='margin-right:-2em;' 
            alt="Bits and transistors.">
        <b>Before you can really understand how memory or your CPU
        works</b>, you need to understand a little bit about how
        instructions and data are stored in the computer.
    </p>
    <p> Transistors, the basic building block of all integrated
        circuits, have only two states, like a light
        switch. A transistor, at any given time is either <b>on</b>,
        meaning that it can act as a pathway for an electrical
        circuit, or <b>off</b>, meaning that it won't conduct
        electricity.
    </p>
    <p> Because of this on/off characteristic, each transistor in
        memory or on a CPU can be used to store a single
        <b>binary number</b> with one of the two
        values <b>0</b> (if the transistor is off) or
        <b>1</b> (if the transistor is on). We call this
        single transistor, that stores one binary number, a
        <b>bit</b> or <b>binary digit</b>.<br />
                 <img src="images/b07.gif" style='margin-right: -2em;' 
        class='right shadow border'  alt="Two bytes.">

    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, by itself, a single bit is not very useful,
        but, when combined with other bits, they can be used to
        <b>represent</b> more things like decimal numbers, text,
        images, sounds, and even program instructions.
    </p>
    <p> Almost all computers today, work with groups of eight
        bits, called a <b>byte</b>, (b-y-t-e, not b-i-t-e). For
        what it's worth, a group of four bits, or half a byte, is
        called a <b>nybble</b>, also with a y instead of an i.
    </p>
    <p> When treated as a binary number, a single byte can store
        256 different values, and, as mentioned, those values can be
        <b>interpreted</b> as numbers, characters, images, or instructions.
        This <b>translation</b> between the raw byte values stored in memory
        and the meaning that we assign to those bytes is known as its <b>data type</b>.
    </p>
    <div class="sidebar">
    <p class='stitle'>Hexadecimal Numbers</p>
    <p> Some early computer
        systems used other groups of bits&#8212;combinations of 3 bits,
        6 bits or 12 bits, but the byte-oriented machines won
        out for one simple reason. Using the base-16 number system,
        called <b>hexadecimal</b>, you can represent a byte value using
        two digits, one digit for each 4-bit nybble in an easily
        readable format.
        <br>&nbsp;<br>
        Hexadecimal uses the regular decimal digits 0 to 9, along
        with the first five letters of the alphabet for the numbers
        10-15. Using this scheme, you write the decimal value 255
        as FF instead of writing the actual binary number which
        is 11111111. <b>Hexadecimal is simply a shorthand way of
        representing binary numbers.</b>
    </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Physical Memory</h3>
    <p><img src="images/memory.png" class='right'  style='width:300px; margin-top:-3em;'
        alt="A DIMM memory module.">
    When a computer runs, both the instructions that it
        carries out, and the data that it processes are stored
        in <b>memory</b>. Memory is simply a particular kind of
        integrated circuit, mounted on a circuit board called a
        <b>memory module</b>.
    </p>
    <p> The picture shown here is a <b>DIMM</b> or Dual Inline
        Memory Module, which has chips mounted on both sides of
        the circuit board. The memory module fits into a special
        slot on the motherboard called a memory slot.
    </p>
    <p> The key to understanding how memory works is to realize
        that it is <b>addressable</b>; each byte of memory
        in your computer has its own unique location, which is
        called its <b>address</b>. 
        Because of this addressability, when your program runs,
        the CPU can say things like: "add the two numbers located at
        the addresses 120 and 122", or "execute the instruction
        you'll find in memory at address 1000".
    </p>
    <h4>Random Access</h4>
    <p> Usually when we talk about a computer's memory, we are
        referring to <b>Random Access Memory</b> or <b>RAM</b>.
        When we say "my computer has 8
        Gigabytes of memory" we are referring to the amount of
        RAM the computer has. This kind of memory is also
        called <b>main memory</b> or <b>primary storage</b>.
    </p>
    <p> There are two important things you need to understand
        about RAM:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, RAM is <b>read/write</b> memory; it can be
            changed by the CPU as your program runs. RAM is where
            your letters are stored while you are typing them, and
            where different programs are loaded as you use your
            computer. Since it is read/write memory, its contents
            aren't fixed.
        </li>
        <li>Second, RAM is <b>volatile</b>. That means it <b>only</b>
            retains the data you store as long as the computer is
            turned on. Once you turn the power off, your data is
            lost. That's why <b>secondary storage</b> devices
            such as disk
            drives are so important.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div class='sidebar'>
    <p class='stitle'>Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes and Friends</p>
    <p> A <b>kilobyte</b> or <b>KB</b> consists of 1024 bytes (2^10 = 1024).
        Since computers are binary devices, we usually refer to bytes
        in sizes that are a power of 2. A page of ordinary text takes about
        2 KB to store. A short email also takes up just 1 or 2 kilobytes.
        Text is very compact because about one or two bytes are required
        to store each letter (depending on the kind of alphabet used).
    </p>
    <p> A <b>megabyte</b> or <b>MB</b> is technically 1024 kilobytes, or
        roughly 1 million bytes. A few minutes of MP3 or a 10 mega-pixel image
        from a digital camera takes up few megabytes.
    </p>
    <p> A <b>gigabyte</b> or <b>GB</b> is 1024 megabytes, or roughly 1 billion bytes.
        A typical hard drive in 2011 stores about 500 GB; a computer might have
        4 GB of RAM; a flash memory card used in a camera might store 4 GB.
        A DVD disk has a capacity of about 5 GB.
    </p>
    <p> A <b>terabyte</b> or <b>TB</b> is 1024 gigabytes, or roughly 1 trillion bytes.
        Terabyte hard disk drives are now coming into common use.
    </p>
    </div>
    <p> There is one small problem with the word "megabyte" (and, by extension, with
        the terms gigabyte and terabyte). Is a megabyte 1024 x 1024 bytes, that is
        1,048,576, or does it mean exactly 1 million. That depends on who you ask.
        The store selling you a new hard drive uses the 1 million figure, since it
        makes the drives look larger.
    </p>
    <p> To rectify this confusion, the terms "kibibyte", "mebibyte", "gibibyte" and
        "tebibyte" have been introduced to specifically mean the 1024 based
        units. Wikipedia <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibibyte' target='_blank'>
        <b>has an article</b></a> that explains these different terms, which
        haven't really caught on all that much. You don't need to memorize the
        exact sizes, but you should know that terms like "megabyte" can be a little
        fluid, depending on who is using them, and in what context.
    </p>
    <h3>Text and Memory</h3>
    <p>Most of us use <b>characters</b> much more often than numbers.
        Characters, and groups of characters, (sentences, paragraphs,
        chapters, books, libraries), form the basis for human
        language and, arguably, civilization.
        <img src="images/z05.gif" alt="Using the Enigma encryption machine" class='right'>
    </p>
    <p> The first computer applications were, interestingly
        enough, all about words, specifically the secret codes used
        during World War II. The first research into "computing" as
        we know it was carried out by the mathematician, Dr. Alan
        Turing, and his colleagues at Blechley Park in England, where
        they built Collosus, a code-breaking computer designed to
        break Germany's Enigma cipher.
    </p>
    <p> Once the war was over, however, computers moved out of the
        academic and espionage communities and into the corporate
        arena, where they were seen as glorified accounting machines.
        It wouldn't be until the 1970s, with the Wang word processor,
        that businesses realized that computers could deal with words
        as well as numbers.
        <br style='clear:both'>
    </p>
    <h4>How Characters Are Stored</h4>
    <p>The problem with storing
        characters in a computer is that, to put it bluntly,
        <b><span class="red">you can't</span></b>.
        Computers can <b>only</b> store and process
        binary numbers&#8212;nothing else. That means to store text inside
        the computer, it must be represented as a series of binary
        numbers; it must be <b>encoded</b>.
    </p>
    <p> <img src="images/ascii.gif" class="right" alt="A portion of the ASCII chart.">
        How do you convert binary numbers into characters?
        The answer is simple; you just agree to a particular
        correspondence between a number and a character,
        similar to Morse-Code. 
    </p>
    <p> If everyone agrees that
        the letter 'A' is represented by the binary number 1, the
        letter 'B' is represented by the binary number 2, and so
        on, then storing text becomes easy.
    </p>
    <p> Originally, each computer maker designed their
        own number-to-character encoding schemes, such as <b>EBCDIC</b>
        used on IBM mainframes, and <b>ASCII</b> used on PCs. Recently, with
        the advance of the Internet, <b>Unicode</b> has become the
        standard character encoding used across the world. You'll learn more
        about how Java uses Unicode later in the semester. For right now, I'll use the
        terms ASCII and Unicode interchangeably, since the first 127 character
        codes are the same in both schemes.
    </p>
    <h2>Software and the CPU</h2>
        <p><b>You can purchase the greatest,
            most impressive, most expensive home theater</b> system in the world,
            but, without a NetFlix subscription, or at least a DVD to watch, 
            it's just an expensive doorstop. The same thing is true with your 
            computer&#8212;hardware's nice, but
            it's <b>nothing</b> without <b>software</b>.
            <img class="right" src="images/theater.gif" style='width:250px;' alt="A home theater system.">
        </p>
        <p> Let's look at the two types of software:
            the kind that "does things for your computer"&#8212;called the
            <b>operating system</b>, and the kind that "does things for you"&#8212;called
            <b>application programs</b>.  We'll also take a look at how computer
            programs work "under the hood."
        </p>
        <p> A computer program is simply <b>"a set of instructions
            that tells the computer what to do."</b> Think of a
            program as an recipe for accomplishing a particular task&mdash;a
            recipe that your computer is able to "understand" and execute.
        </p>
        <p> Microsoft Word is a program, as is Microsoft Excel. Quicken,
            Doom, iTunes, and your Web Browser are all programs. Even
            Windows, Mac OSX and Linux are programs, (or, technically, collections of programs.)
        </p>
    <h3>Running &amp; Installing Programs</h3>
        <p> <img src='images/play_green.png' class='right' style='width:100px;' alt='A VCR play button.'>
            To watch the latest DVD or BlueRay release that you've rented
            at the library you have to <b>load it</b> into your DVD or BlueRay player, and press <b>play</b>.
            Software is very similar.
        </p>
        <p> You <b>play</b> a DVD, but you <b>run</b> or <b>execute</b> a program.
            To run a program, you transfer it from your hard disk, or over the
            network, and load it into memory. Once the program is loaded, you tell
            the CPU where the instructions start, and your computer takes over
            from there.
        </p>
        <p> There is one big difference between running a program and
            playing a DVD. Your DVD player works <i>directly</i> from the
            disc you rent, loading only as much of the movie as is needed
            into memory at any one time.
        </p>
        <div class='info'>
        <p> I know, I know; <i>nobody</i> but old folks like me actually use
            physical media like DVDs or BlueRay discs. However, even if you <i>stream</i>
            your movies over the 'Net, the movie still needs to be loaded into memory
            before your TV will play it. That's what all those "buffering" messages
            actually mean.
        </p>
        </div>
        <p> When you get a program via a download, or on a DVD, you usually won't
            run it directly. Instead, you'll often go through a process called
            <b>installing</b> the software. You'll need to do this to put
            the Java JDK on your machine, for instance.
        </p>
        <p> Installation usually unpacks the compressed file you downloaded, and 
            also performs other tasks, such as creating desktop
            icons and menu entries, and performing product activation. 
        </p>
        <p> The down-side of program installation is that it can make it
            very hard to move the location of a program on the hard disk,
            if you decide to reorganize your computer, or if you want to
            move the program to a new computer. I, personally, prefer programs
            that don't require a complex installation step, and that keep all
            of their files in a single folder, so I can 
            easily move them from computer to computer. That's what I've done
            with the custom Dr. Java program we'll be using in this class.
        </p>
    <h3>Talking to your Programs</h3>
        <p> With your DVD player, you "talk to your movie" by using the
            <b>play</b> and <b>pause</b> buttons on your remote control.
            How do you talk to your computer programs? Exactly how do you
            tell your computer that you want to run the latest Star Trek game?
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/startrek4.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;" alt="Hello Computer from Star Trek 4">
            You could try just talking to your computer like Scotty did when
            he first met a Macintosh in Star Trek 4
            (<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9kTVZiJ3Uc' target='_blank'><b>"Hello Computer!"</b></a>).
            More and more, with Siri and other speech recognition software, that
            might just work. (I no longer worry about my sausage-sized fingers when 
            texting, because I do everything with voice.)
        </p>
    <h4>The User Interface</h4>
        <p> Just as your
            DVD remote control allows you to communicate with your DVD player,
            your computer has a <b>user interface</b> that allows you to send
            commands to your software.
        </p>
        <p> With a <b>graphical</b> user interface, or GUI, like Windows or
            Mac OS X, you interact with your programs in the form of small graphical
            images, called <b>icons</b>, and other features such as pull-down menus.
            To run a program with a GUI, for instance, you <b>point</b> to it using
            the <b>mouse pointer</b>, and <b>double-click</b> the mouse button.
        </p>
        <p class="note"><img src="images/wimp.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;" alt="The Wimp interface.">
            This is sometimes called the WIMP interface, for
            Window, Icon, Mouse, and Pointer; it's mostly called that by
            old computer folk, like me, who remember when we
            had to talk to our computers using nothing but ones and zeros.
            Of course, when things got tough and supplies ran low,
            we skipped the zeros.
            <img src='../images/smiley.gif' style='vertical-align:top;' alt='A smiley face icon.'>
        </p>
        <p> The GUI is also responsible for controlling the different ways
            you'll enter data, providing <b>input widgets</b> such as text
            fields, text areas, sliders and buttons, and for controlling
            the display of information, translating things like the plain
            text code that make up a Web page into the printed type and
            graphics that you see on the page in front of you.
        </p>
        <p> Most modern operating systems also have a <b>command-line</b> interface,
            where you "talk" to your computer using simple English-like (sometimes)
            commands. The command-line often allows you to use your computer more
            efficiently, but it's not as easy to remember or to learn. In this class
            we'll be using a GUI, but those of you going to CS 150 (C++ 1) will learn
            to use the Unix command line.
        </p>
        <p> If you've never encountered the command-line before, and think that
            it's a relic of some bygone age, you might want to read Neal Stephenson's
            essay, <a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html" target="_blank">
            <b>In the Beginning was the Command Line</b></a> for a different
            perspective.
        </p>
    <h2>Computer Software</h2>
        <p>  <img src="images/tron_large_warner.jpg" class='right shadow' alt="The Master Control Program">
            There are two general categories of computer programs. The first
            kind of program we call <b>system software</b>. System software
            is the software that "runs" your computer. In the old 1970s
            Sci-fi movie TRON, systems software was personified by David Warner,
            the notorious Master Control Program that controlled all access
            to memory and hardware.
        </p>
        <p> Your computer <b>really does</b> have a master control program,
            called the <b>operating system</b>, and the operating system
            <b>really does</b> control all access to your hardware. Your
            hard disk, for instance, is made up of concentric magnetic recording
            areas called tracks and sectors. Most of us, however, <b>never</b>
            deal with tracks and sectors directly. Instead, our operating
            system allows us to "pretend" that our hard disk contains
            files and folders.
        </p>
        <p> You don't load and run the operating system in the same way you
            do other programs. Instead, the operating system loads automatically
            when your computer first starts, and continues running, (in the
            "background"), as long as your computer is turned on. Modern operating
            systems also operate at a higher "privilege level" than normal
            programs, preventing regular programs from damaging your computer
            to some extent.
        </p>
    <h3>Application Software</h3>
        <p> When you hear the term software, you probably automatically think of
            <b>application software</b>, programs that perform a specific
            job&#8212;software that <b>does something for you</b>, rather than
            software that does something for your computer.
        </p>
        <p> <img src="images/applications.gif" style="border: 1px solid black; float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;" alt="Application programs in a store.">
            There are different application programs for every different kind
            of job, industry, business, and hobby you can imagine. You can
            purchase application software at stores like Fry's or Micro Center
            just like buying cornflakes down at Stater Brothers. (Or, more often today,
            you'll buy and download it from Amazon or the App Store.)
        </p>
        <p> This kind of "pre-packaged" software is called <b>shrink-wrap</b> or
            <b>horizontal-market</b> software, so-called because your local
            dentist probably uses the same kind of software as that used by
            General Motors; it's not specific to one kind of business.
            Shrink-wrap software includes things like word processors,
            spreadsheets, database software, and presentation software.
        </p>
        <p> You can also have application software <b>custom made</b> to meet
            the exact needs of your business. This might seem exotic, kind of like having
            custom-made shoes or shirts, but it's really very common; it's more
            like ordering dinner in a restaurant. Most applications software, in fact, is
            custom made or <b>vertical-market</b> software.
        </p>
        <div class='info'>
        <p>I should also mention another category of software
            that may be even more common: <b>embedded software</b>. Embedded
            software is code that runs "behind the scenes", kind of like the
            operating system, on your mobile phone, your TV tuner, your music
            player, your automobile and maybe even your toaster. And with new
            platforms like the iPhone and Google's Android, this market will
            only get bigger.
        </p>
        </div>
    <h3>Computer Programmers</h3>
        <p> Shrink-wrap software, custom software, applications programs,
            and operating systems; all of these are created by
            <b>computer programmers</b>. Programmer is the general purpose
            name we give to anyone who develops applications or system software.
        </p>
        <p> <img src="images/programmer.gif" class="right" alt="A computer programmer.">
            Of course, that's a little like using the term <i>scientist</i> to
            describe a wide variety of different jobs, and so the computing
            professions have developed more specific terms. You may hear
            programmers called <i>software developers</i>, <i>system analysts</i>,
            <i>software architects</i>, <i>software engineers</i>,
            <i>magicians</i>,
            <i><b><a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4TfDs9veis' target='_blank'>code monkeys</a></b></i>, or <i>digital gurus</i>.
        </p>
        <p> In the end, though, a software developer is <b>really</b> like an
            author or songwriter; the programmer produces a tangible document,
            (called the program's <b>source code</b>), which contains instructions
            that the computer is able to follow. (For a really simple example of
            source code, just choose <b>View Source</b> from your Web browser's
            menu, and you'll see the instructions the Web programmer (me in
            this case), wrote to create this Web page.)
        </p>
        <p> In this class, you'll learn to write computer programs
            (source code) using the Java programming language. Once you've
            written your programs, you'll use different software tools, such as
            those found in the Java Development Kit or those supplied as part
            of your IDE (Integrated Development Environment), to
            <b>compile</b> your source code into a special kind of <b>machine
            language</b> known as <b>bytecode</b> which can be understood
            or "played" by an ideal computer known as the <b>Java Virtual Machine</b>
            or <b>JVM</b>. When you want to <b>run</b> your program, you'll start
            up the JVM and it will convert your program into the <b>native</b>
            machine language which will be executed by your computer's hardware CPU.
        </p>
        <p> We'll turn to writing Java programs shortly, but let's start out by
            seeing how the CPU works to run <b>native code</b>.
        </p>
    <h2>How Programs Work</h2>
        <p> 
            The Central Processing Unit, also known as the
            <b>CPU</b> or simply <b>the processor</b>, is the
            "brains" inside your computer. The CPU interprets
            and carries out the basic instructions that operate
            the computer.
        </p>
        <img src="images/a01.gif" class='inlineCenter shadow border' alt="The CPU block diagram.">
        <p> We can divide the CPU itself into two main subsystems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <b>Control Unit</b> coordinates all of the
                operations of the CPU. When the CPU needs to "talk" to
                memory, for instance, the CU issues the commands to
                retrieve or store the necessary bytes or instructions.
            </li>
            <li>When it comes to actual calculation or decision making,
                however, the CU turns that over to the
                <b>Arithmetic-Logic Unit</b> or <b>ALU</b>. All
                math, comparison, or logical operations are performed
                by the ALU.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> When you run an application program, like Excel, the CPU
            doesn't deal with the entire program at once. Instead,
            it processes each instruction or piece of data sequentially.
            When you start Excel, the program is loaded into memory,
            but the instructions and data are fed to the CPU one piece at
            a time.
        </p>
        <p class="note"> Even though the CPU and memory are the main players in the
            computing game, they don't work alone: <b>input devices</b>
            are necessary to capture data for processing by the CPU,
            and <b>output devices</b> are necessary if you want to see
            the information that results. Finally, all three of these
            components&#8212;instructions, data, and output&#8212;are written to,
            and read from storage devices during the processing cycle.
        </p>
    <h3>Registers</h3>
        <p> At the beginning of this section, I said that programs were
            instructions, stored in memory, which are <b>executed</b>
            or <b>run</b> by the CPU. That's really only <b>partly</b>
            true. The CPU can't actually do <b>anything</b> with
            instructions or data while it is stored in memory. Instead,
            it has to <b>fetch</b> the instruction and place it in
            a <b>register</b>, before it can get "worked on".
        </p>
        <p> A register is just a <b>temporary, high-speed storage area</b>,
            located on the CPU, which holds data and instructions while
            processing occurs. Different processors have different names,
            sizes, and numbers of registers, but all processors use
            registers to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>store the address of the next instruction to be executed</li>
            <li>store the instruction itself while the it is being decoded</li>
            <li>store the data that the ALU uses while processing</li>
            <li>store the results of the ALU's calculations</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The CPU registers are used by both the ALU and the Control Unit
            in a complex choreography called <b>the machine cycle</b>.
        </p>
    <h2>The Machine Cycle</h2>
        <p> In some ways, your CPU is really a very simple machine&#8212;you plug
            it in, and it starts "crunching" data. While the actual
            instructions that can be carried out by the CPU may change from
            processor to processor, the internal workings of all CPUs are
            remarkably similar, consisting of four basic operations. We
            call these four operations the <b>machine cycle</b>.<br>
            <img src="images/a12.gif" alt="The machine cycle." class='inlineCenter shadow'>
            The machine cycle begins by <b>retrieving</b> a machine language
            instruction from memory. What instruction? The instruction
            located at the address contained in the PC or Program Counter
            register. (Intel CPUs call this register the IP or Instruction Pointer).
            Once the instruction is retrieved, or <b>fetched</b>,
            the program counter is automatically ratcheted forward to
            point to the <b>next</b> instruction in memory.
        </p>
    <h3>Bits is Bits</h3>
        <p> The important thing you should take away from this lesson,
            is that your computer <b>really can't tell</b> which values in memory
            represent instructions, and which represent data. <b>Everything</b> stored
            in your computer is represented as <b>bits</b>. There is no difference in memory between data, instructions, characters,
            images, or sounds.
        </p>

        <div class='center'>
            <br><span style='font-size:3em;background:none;'>Bits is bits.</span>
            <div style='margin:auto'>
            <object class='shadow' alt='A Wendys TV commercial from YouTube.'
                type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
                style="width:425px;height:344px;"
                data="http://www.youtube.com/v/OTzLVIc-O5E&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1">
                <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/OTzLVIc-O5E&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1">
                <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true">

                <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always">
            </object>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            That's right; the bits that make up instructions look exactly the same
            to the computer as the bits that make up data. The only difference is
            where those bits are placed, and how your program interprets them.
            If you "point" your CPU's Program Counter at a GIF image, for instance,
            it will treat the bits it contains as instructions, and try to carry
            them out.
        </p>
        <p> Most of the time, when this happens, your computer will "crash"
            almost immediately, since the instructions won't make any sense. Sometimes,
            though, a clever hacker may craft a specially prepared piece of data, and
            take advantage of a programming error to get the CPU to execute the data
            and take over the computer. This kind of vulnerability is known as a
            <b>buffer overflow</b>.
